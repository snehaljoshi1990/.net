Learning .NET involves several steps, but it's an achievable and rewarding journey. Here's a roadmap to get started:

Understand the Basics:

Familiarize yourself with the basics of programming if you're new to it. Understand concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
Get comfortable with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles as they are fundamental to .NET development.
Choose a Language:

.NET supports multiple languages, with C# being the most popular. Other options include F# and Visual Basic .NET. Choose one to focus on; C# is recommended due to its widespread use and extensive resources.
Install Visual Studio:

Download and install Visual Studio, the integrated development environment (IDE) for .NET development. Visual Studio Community Edition is free and provides all the necessary tools.
Learn the Framework:

Understand the .NET Framework or .NET Core/.NET 5/6 depending on the version available. These frameworks provide libraries and tools for building various types of applications.
Familiarize yourself with the core libraries for tasks like file I/O, networking, and database access.
